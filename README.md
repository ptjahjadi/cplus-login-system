# CPLUS Login System
Create an account with this program and interact with the program using your accounts
## Aim
The aim of this project is to let users store their ID and passwords. Future work would include features that let users interact with their accounts. This program is written in C++.

The program is divided into phases (WIP):
* Phase 1A (12 May 2021): The program is able to store User ID and password to a file. Users would be able to register their accounts using this program.
* Phase 1B (14 May 2021): The program can read all the stored IDs and passwords in a file.
* Phase 1C (15 May 2021): Users can now login using their existing ID and password if they have already registered. The program will also prevent registration using existing user IDs.

## Setting Up
This program is written using Visual Studio Code in Ubuntu, but can be run using any mainstream operating system. 
In order to modify this program and compile it, pleasure ensure you have MingW and the G++ compiler. These programs should be readily available for Linux distributions.
Any command-line interpreter can be used to run the program (Windows CMD, Ubuntu Terminal, etc.).
